# Room Automation System (IoT) - Cisco Packet Tracer

## Aim
I designed and simulated a room automation system in Cisco Packet Tracer that allows remote monitoring and control of a fan and a lamp.

## Problem Statement
Today, smart homes need simple automation to save energy and improve convenience. This project demonstrates how basic devices like a fan and lamp can be automated and monitored remotely using Cisco Packet Tracer.

## Scope of the Solution
- Enables IoT-based control of home devices.
- Shows how to connect and configure IoT devices in Packet Tracer.
- Helps understand the concept of smart home automation.

## Required Components
- Cisco Packet Tracer software
- Home Gateway (IoT server)
- IoT Fan
- IoT Lamp
- Tablet (for monitoring and controlling)

## Files Included
- `Room_Automation.pkt` → Cisco Packet Tracer simulation file
- `demo_screenshot.png` → Screenshot of my IoT Monitor working
- `demo_video.mp4` (optional) → Recording of my demo

## How to Run
1. Open the `Room_Automation.pkt` file in Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Use the Tablet to access the IoT Monitor.
3. Login with:
   - Username: admin
   - Password: admin
4. You can now switch the Fan and Lamp ON/OFF remotely.
